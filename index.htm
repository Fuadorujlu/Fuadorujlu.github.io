<h1>Euclid</h1>
<p>Euclid died by soldier while working on circles, after protecting the city for so long <br>
He was the one who said Eureka after discovering the volume in the water. <br>
He invented a numerical system, with differences 10^8 as in his time it was done by letters, so it was hard to construct a big number. <br>
He thought somewhat 10^61 * smt of grains of sand would fill the entire cosmos. Very far from reality but a great thinker <br>
Euclidean algorithm - invention of his </p>

<h1>Leonhard Euler</h1>
<p>Solved basel problem, the seven bridges of Koningsberg - Kaliningrad <br>
Euler's number, e^i*pi = -1 and the founder of e^iO = cosO + i*sinO bringing 3 subjects of math together. <br>
Worked under Bernoulli, and had bad relation with the king at the time, so the Catherina the great invited him and the king was forced to let him go. <br>
He gave contributions to the movement of the Celestial bodies. </p>

<h1>Andrew Wiles</h1>
<p>Andrew Wiles- Who proved fermat's last theorem by proving taniyama-shimura conjecture proving the main conjecture of Iwasawa theory, over many many years. <br> The theorem was unsolved for 300 years. </p>
